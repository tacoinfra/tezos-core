# Tezos Core

Tezos-Core packages several core features used across TacoInfra's Tezos work.

The following are exported:
- `CodingUtils`: Encoding / Decoding utilities
- `Prefix`: Prefixes for Tezos objects
- `Watermark`: Watermarks for Tezos operations

This library is well tested and suitable to depend upon in production.
